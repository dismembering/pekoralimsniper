# Pekora Limited Sniper  

A fully automated Limited sniper—no more just notifications. This is the real deal for 2025.  

## Features:  
- Monitors the item releases channel in Discord.  
- Automatically purchases items when a link is posted.  
- Requires a webhook, `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie, and Discord token.  
- If you encounter SSL errors, consider using a VPN or Cloudflare WARP.  

**Note:** If this method gets patched, I will not be providing updates.  

## Requirements:  
- `discord.py-self`  
- `requests`  
- `re`  
- `json`  

## Troubleshooting:  
- If you encounter errors, you may need to manually obtain a CSRF token.  
- In case the seller starts validating CSRF tokens, you might need to implement a function to fetch them for every request.  

No hidden malware—feel free to inspect the code.
